CIRCOM ZKP Hash Checker WORKSPACE

Welcome to the Remix Circom ZKP Hash Checker Workspace. 

The workspace comprises two main directories:

- circuits: Contains sample Hash Checker contracts. These can be compiled to generate a witness using 'Circom ZKP Compiler' plugin.
- scripts: Provides a sample script designed for a trusted setup using snarkjs. This script also aids in generating Solidity code, 
which is essential for on-chain deployment.
