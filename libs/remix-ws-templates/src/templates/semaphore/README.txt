REMIX CIRCOM WORKSPACE

Welcome to the Remix Circom Workspace. This workspace becomes available when you create a new workspace using the 'Circom' template.
Directory Structure

The workspace comprises two main directories:

    circuits: Contains sample semaphore contracts. These can be compiled to generate a witness.
    scripts: Provides a sample script designed for a trusted setup using snarkjs. This script also aids in generating Solidity code, which is essential for on-chain deployment.
