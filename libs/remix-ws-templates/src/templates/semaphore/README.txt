CIRCOM ZKP SEMAPHORE WORKSPACE

Welcome to the Remix Circom ZKP Semaphore Workspace. 

The workspace comprises two main directories:

- circuits: Contains sample semaphore contracts. These can be compiled to generate a witness using 'Circom ZKP Compiler' plugin.
- scripts: Provides a sample script designed for a trusted setup using snarkjs. This script also aids 
in generating Solidity code, which is essential for on-chain deployment.
