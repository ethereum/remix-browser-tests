## What's RLN?

RLN is a zero-knowledge gadget that enables spam 
prevention in anonymous environments.

The core parts of RLN are:
* zk-circuits in Circom (this repo);
* [registry smart-contract](https://github.com/Rate-Limiting-Nullifier/rln-contract);
* set of libraries to build app with RLN ([rlnjs](https://github.com/Rate-Limiting-Nullifier/rlnjs), [zerokit](https://github.com/vacp2p/zerokit)).
